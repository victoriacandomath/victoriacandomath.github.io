## Welcome to My Blog

The purpose of this blog is to explore GitHub's functionalities, while also doing my own research and projects. You can view my projects from my classes and others that I have pursued on my own.

For now, this is not meant to be a very robust blog. 

Here, you should be able to find some Java projects I have completed in the past (they're pretty simple, but I'm very proud of them). As well as other posts about resarch topics I'm interested in; including, but not limited to: machine learning, computer graphics and animation, blockchain, and GIS.

Just so you know, I'm a student! I am using this platform to _learn_. I know in the future I'll have to know how to use Git, so why not start now? If you're here, I hope you find some of this interesting, or maybe even a bit amusing. In any case, I look forward to creating and writing in this space.
